### üöÄ Mars Terraforming Sim V2 - Project Overview üåå

---

## üå† Project Vision

We're building an immersive Mars exploration and terraforming simulation that blends RPG, survival, and sandbox elements to offer a comprehensive, interactive experience. Inspired by acclaimed games like **Surviving Mars**, **Subnautica**, and **No Man's Sky**, our vision is to place players into a dynamic, believable near-future scenario centered around realistic and detailed terraforming and colonization of Mars. Players will be challenged to transform an inhospitable Martian surface into a thriving, self-sustaining ecosystem, making strategic decisions to balance survival, exploration, and environmental transformation.

## üéØ High-Level Goals

- **Mars Exploration:** Navigate an expansive, detailed Martian landscape dynamically generated and rendered using Babylon.js, offering diverse geographical features and interactive terrain.
- **Realistic Terraforming:** Implement scientifically-informed soil treatment mechanics, requiring careful management of nitrates, nutrients, fungi cultivation, and plant growth progression.
- **Resource Collection & Management:** Harvest and utilize essential raw materials including Metal, Silicon, Carbon, Oxygen, H2O, and Hydrogen, to craft tools, equipment, structures, and vehicles essential for survival and colonization.
- **Comprehensive Base-Building:** Construct and manage essential structures like greenhouses, domes, habitats, and infrastructure with an emphasis on modularity, customization, and expansion, centered around the Starship as a versatile home-base.
- **Detailed Player Progression:** Develop a robust RPG system featuring inventory management, customizable gear, and progression mechanics designed to encourage exploration, resourcefulness, and strategic gameplay.
